# Installation

## Get install archive
Download an install ZIP archive from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lotrocompanion/).

## Unzip
Unzip this archive somewhere on your hard drive.

## Run
This will create a 'LotRO Companion' directory.
Inside this directory, start the 'LotRO Companion.exe'.
You can create a shortcut on your Desktop to launch the application easily.

## Run with WINE on MacOS Mojave
While Lotro Companion can be run on MacOS using the LotroCompanion.sh shell script, you will not be able to import characters from the Lotro Client
in this way. Instead, a new WINE environment needs to be setup to run both the Lotro Client and Lotro Companion. Refer to the
[Installation Guide for WINE](Wine.md).
